God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.

Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.
